## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned several things such as "flex", "center" properties etc. Examples:

```css
text-align: center;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
margin-right: -50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
```

### Continued development

I'll continue exploring the attributes, properties, and values for flex, grid, svg, responsive layouts and more.
